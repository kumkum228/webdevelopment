            <h2>The Jungle Book</h2>
            <h4>Written by: Joseph Rudyard Kipling</h4>
            <p>One hot evening in the hills of south India, the moon is big in
                the sky. Father Wolf is sleeping in his cave with Mother Wolf and
                their four cubs.
                He wakes up and says,
                “It’s time to hunt1
                 again.”
                “Hello!” says a voice.
                It is the jackal Tabaqui. Wolves do not like jackals; they are
                afraid of2
                 them because they are dirty, always angry and they eat
                the rubbish near the villages, too. They also tell lies3
                 and create
                problems for the other animals.
                “Tabaqui! Why are you here?” asks Father Wolf.
                “Good morning, chief of the wolves, have you got something
                for me to eat?”
                “There’s nothing here for you,” Father Wolf answers.
                Looking at the cubs, Tabaqui says,
                “Your children are so beautiful!” but this is not a good thing
                to say. In India, people and animals believe it is unlucky4
                 to tell
                children they’re beautiful
                in front of them.
                “Shere Khan the tiger
                is coming here to hunt,”
                says Tabaqui.
                “What? He can’t do
                that. He must respect the
                Law of the Jungle, he must
                tell us first,” says Father
                Wolf, surprised.

            <p>
                    “Shere Khan wants to hunt food in new territory because the
                    people of the village are angry at him. His leg is bad, and he can’t
                    run fast so he can only kill bulls,” says Mother Wolf.
                    Tabaqui leaves, and soon after Mother Wolf says,
                    “The woods! Listen! It’s his voice… you can hear Shere Khan!”
                    Father Wolf listens and says,
                    “Shere Khan is not a clever animal! He’s making a lot of noise.
                    All the animals are running away and hiding5
                    in the jungle. I can’t look around for food now!”
                    “Shut up, listen! There’s a noise…” says Mother Wolf.
                    Father Wolf is ready to jump to defend his family, but Mother
                    Wolf says, “It’s the noise of… a man!”
                    “What…? A man?” shouts Father Wolf.
                    The Law of the Jungle says that animals must not kill men
                    because many men with guns can come to the jungle and then all
                    the animals are in danger.
                    “Look!” says Mother Wolf. “Someone’s coming near the cave.
                    Be careful!”
                    Father Wolf sees a baby in front of him under the leaves of a tree.
                    The baby is chubby and brown. He has no hair and clothes. He
                    can’t walk very well. The small baby looks at Father Wolf and laughs. “What’s that? Is that a man cub?” 
                    says Mother Wolf curiously. “I
                    want to look at it, bring it here, please.”
                    Father Wolf carries it to Mother Wolf carefully.
                    The baby starts drinking her milk with the other cubs.
                    Mother Wolf says happily,
                    “He’s not afraid, look! He’s drinking my milk with our cubs.”
                </p>

                <img src="img/s2.png">
                <img src="img/s3.png">
                <img src="img/s4.png">

                <p>Shere Khan arrives and puts his big head inside the cave. It is
                    immediately dark. Tabaqui is with him.
                    “We’re really pleased to see you, Shere Khan. What do you
                    want?” says Father Wolf with his angry eyes.
                    “I want the man cub, it’s mine! Give it to me!”
                    ‘Shere Khan can’t fight… he can’t enter the cave because he’s
                    too big’, thinks Father Wolf.
                    “The man cub is ours and you have no right to have him,” says
                    Father Wolf. “Wolves obey10 the leader of the pack11… He can
                    decide what to do with the cub, not you.”
                    Shere Khan starts roaring12 and his eyes are very angry.
                    “The man cub is mine!” repeats Shere Khan and his voice is
                    like thunder13 in the cave. “His parents and men are afraid of me,
                    and they run off14 when they see me! Now I can eat the child!”
                    Raksha, Mother Wolf, quickly jumps in front of Shere Khan to
                    defend her cubs and shouts,
                    “No! He’s my son! The man cub is mine and you can’t kill him!
                    Go away!”
                </p>

                <p>Father Wolf is really surprised at Mother Wolf’s reaction, but
                    then he remembers that Raksha was very strong and brave15 when
                    she was young; her nickname16 was “The Demon”.
                    Shere Khan goes away because he knows he can’t fight Mother
                    Wolf in the cave.
                    “One day that cub will be mine… the pack must decide for
                    him…” he says, angry.
                    “He’s right,” says Father Wolf when Shere Khan leaves. “We
                    must show the man cub to the pack on the next full moon. Do you
                    really want to keep17 him? Are you sure?” he then asks looking at
                    Mother Wolf.
                    “Yes, I do. I’m sure! Look, he is happy here, he is well with us. I
                    want to call him Mowgli the frog.”
                    The Law of the Jungle says that the pack must see all the wolf
                    cubs when they can walk during the pack council18, then the cubs
                    are free to go where they want. All the wolves meet for the council
                    once a month at full moon. They look at all the wolf cubs carefully
                    so that they can recognise them.
                    The Law of the Jungle also says that an adult wolf can’t kill
                    a wolf cub before the wolf cub kills a deer19. The punishment is
                    death.
                    After some time, when their four cubs can walk, Father Wolf
                    and Mother Wolf take them and Mowgli to the Council Rock20 – a
                    high hill with big stones where all the wolves meet.
                    Akela, the leader of the pack, is sitting on a big rock. He is
                    a grey wolf, strong and brave. He lives alone. Many wolves of
                    different ages are around him and all the wolf cubs are in front
                    of him inside the circle of their parents. For each wolf cub Akela
                    says,
                    “Look carefully, wolves! You know the Law of the Jungle. Look
                    carefully!”
                </p>

                <img src="img/s5.png">
                <p>Finally, Father Wolf pushes21 Mowgli in front of Akela and the
                    other wolves and says,
                    “This is Mowgli, the frog.”
                    Mowgli, in the centre of the circle, is laughing and playing with
                    some little stones.
                    Akela repeats the same sentence,
                    “Look, wolves, look carefully,” but suddenly the wolves hear
                    Shere Khan’s voice behind the hill.
                    “The man cub is mine! Give him to me!” he shouts.
                    Akela does not move and says,
                    “Look carefully! Who speaks for this man cub? Two voices must
                    speak for him, but not his father and mother.”
                    A big, brown, sleepy22 bear appears in front of Akela.
                    “Baloo!” says Akela with surprise.
                    Baloo teaches the Law of the Jungle to wolf cubs and can speak
                    at the meetings of the Council. Everyone likes him because he
                    doesn’t hunt, and eats only roots23, honey and nuts.
                    “I speak for the man cub… I can teach him the Law of the Jungle
                    with the other wolf cubs…” says Baloo with his low voice.
                    “Very well,” says Akela, “but it’s not enough… another animal
                    must speak for the man cub. Who speaks for Mowgli?”
                    A black shadow24 jumps down into the circle. It is Bagheera, the
                    black panther. He is brave, strong and clever.
                    “Akela, can I speak?” asks Bagheera gently25
                    .
                    “Yes, you can,” answers Akela.
                </p>
                
                <p>“The Law of the Jungle says that it is possible to buy the life of
                    a cub. I can give you a fat bull26 to eat. Don’t kill the man cub, he
                    can’t hurt27 you. Let28 him live!” says Bagheera.
                    “Very good,” says Akela. “Look carefully, wolves! Look carefully!”
                    All the wolves walk in a circle around Mowgli and look at him
                    carefully. Then they go down the hill to take the bull because they
                    are very hungry.
                    Only Akela, Baloo, Bagheera
                    and Mowgli’s family are at
                    the Council Rock, and
                    they can hear Shere
                    Khan roaring angrily
                    in the night under the
                    full moon.
                </p>
                    <img src="img/s6.png"> 
                <p> 
                    “I’m very happy. Men and their cubs are clever,” says Akela. “One day this man cub can help us. Now take him away 
                    with you all and teach him
                    everything he must know.”
                    Thanks to Baloo’s good words and Bagheera’s fat bull, Mowgli is
                    now a member of the Seeonee Wolf Pack. He can grow up29 in the
                    wolf family and learn the meaning of all the things in the jungle.
                    Baloo and Bagheera are very good teachers. Bagheera teaches
                    Mowgli that he must never kill bulls even when there is nothing to
                    eat because Bagheera’s bull saved his life.
                    Mowgli also learns to climb30 trees, swim in the river and hunt
                    for his food. When he is not learning, he sits in the sun and sleeps.
                    Sometimes, at night, he leaves the forest and goes to the village, but
                    he does not trust31 men because they catch animals and put them in
                    square boxes. He takes his place at the Council Pack meetings, too.
                    He is a very happy boy and grows up quickly.
