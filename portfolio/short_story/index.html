                        <h3> Story 1: Bholi </h3>
                    </a>
                    <p> This story is about a girl named Bholi who is ugly, stammers, and neglected by her family. She is sent to 
                        school by her father only because the local official insisted. At school, her teacher transforms Bholi from 
                        a shy, dumb girl into a bold, confident student through encouragement and help with her stammering. 
                        Though later promised in marriage to a man much older than her, when he demands a high dowry, Bholi decides 
                        to reject the marriage and instead spend her life serving her parents and teaching at her school.</p>
